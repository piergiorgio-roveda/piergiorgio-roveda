# July, 2025

July was an intense month of exploration and experimentation. Between digging into vast geospatial datasets, testing new frameworks for dashboards, and pushing the limits of AI-assisted coding, I had the chance to refine both my technical skills and my overall approach. Some projects worked well and reached completion, while others became learning experiences that revealed what paths not to take. The month felt like a balance between discovery, trial-and-error, and consolidating knowledge.

## What I Learned

### GeoData Research & Sources

  * I encountered thousands of official websites publishing geographic data.
  * The amount of available geographic information today is massive. Even datasets published 10+ years ago, though outdated, can still be extremely useful.
  * I was already familiar with the variety of publishing methods (different services, column naming conventions, and data types).
  * I realized that adding standard columns and adopting a structured storage method makes it possible to organize the data better.
  * It’s also feasible to build accessible and usable endpoints from these datasets.
  * For cloud storage, I haven’t found a better solution than **Google Drive with 5TB capacity**.

### Developing Dashboards

  * I experimented with **Angular** and **Vue** for building geographic dashboards.
  * I quickly realized how complex it becomes to manage all the necessary customizations for a geographic dashboard.
  * Within just a couple of days, these projects became counterproductive in terms of development time, even for relatively simple dynamic elements.
  * Returning to **Vanilla JavaScript** brought back full control and efficiency.

### Using AI Models for Coding Support

  * This month, I had long coding sessions supported by multiple models: Codestral, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Sonnet 3.5, Sonnet 3.7, Sonnet 4
  * Among these, **Sonnet 3.7** still provides the most suitable and consistent responses for my work.

### Databases & LLMs

  * After a long investigation into why LLMs are not naturally suited to read databases, I came to a useful conclusion.
  * Each table in a database should be assigned a **role and a detailed description**, almost like characters in a video game.
  * These “characters” (tables) should have clear descriptions:

    * What they do
    * Their strengths
    * Their dependencies
    * How they interact with other “characters” (tables)
  * Framing databases this way makes them much easier for an LLM to analyze and understand.

## Conclusion

This month confirmed the value of persistence and iteration. Even when some projects failed, they provided clear insights that shaped the next steps. I strengthened my perspective on how to handle geodata, how to simplify development with the right tools, and how to frame databases for LLM integration. Most importantly, I saw how returning to simplicity often yields better results than over-engineering. July closed with a mix of wins, lessons, and a stronger foundation for the challenges ahead.
