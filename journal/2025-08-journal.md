## What I Learned?

### Understanding Vector Data and GIS Work

Imagine a map: not the paper kind, but the one inside Waze. Every street, building, city boundary isn't just a drawing: behind it there's precise data that says *"this point is at these coordinates, this line represents a road, this polygon represents the boundaries of Milan"*.

These are vector data:

* Points = like the pins you place on Google Maps to mark a bar or a speed camera.
* Lines = roads, rivers, train tracks.
* Polygons = the outlines of a park, neighborhood boundaries, the shape of a building.

I spend my days taking, cleaning, and transforming this data, so it can then be analyzed, visualized, or used to make decisions. It's a bit like when Waze understands where there are traffic jams or road works: behind it there's data organization work that allows the software to "understand" the territory and give you the best route.

The document I had you read explains how today it's not enough to just have the map: we're working on systems that combine geographic data (roads, buildings, earthquakes) with artificial intelligence. In practice, it means asking a map:

* "Show me where there have been earthquakes in the last 20 years in California" â†’ and the map highlights the boundaries of the affected counties.
* Or: "Draw me a 400-meter circle around this school" â†’ and it does it by itself.

I do exactly that type of work: I create the "pipes" and "gears" that make geographic data and AI talk to each other, to arrive at simple and useful answers even for those who aren't developers.

So no, I'm not doing secret hacker stuff or dark conspiracies ðŸ˜…. I'm literally taking roads, buildings, neighborhoods and putting them in order inside intelligent systems, so that those who use them can do analysis, decisions, or navigation in a faster and clearer way.


### Lovable â†” GitHub â†” VSCode

While building my dashboard in Lovable, I realized that the platform is great for quickly developing features, but it doesnâ€™t provide a smooth way to separate or highlight important development steps. To solve this, I explored the GitHub sync feature.

By syncing with GitHub, I can now keep track of my work with proper version control and a clear history of changes. This also allows me to continue development locally with RooCode in VSCode, where I have more flexibility to organize, refactor, and manage the project like a proper software product.

- Lovable â†’ fast prototyping.
- GitHub â†’ version control and history.
- RooCode + VSCode â†’ structured, maintainable development.

This workflow gives me both speed and control, without losing track of progress.

## Conclusion

August marked a significant shift from July's experimental phase to a more focused and productive approach. While July was characterized by trial-and-error with various frameworks and the realization that simpler solutions often work better, August built upon those lessons to establish solid, working systems.

The month's standout achievement was the successful development of the geoNotebook ecosystem - both the FastAPI version and the static LAB version. These projects represent the culmination of months of learning about combining geographic data visualization with AI capabilities, creating tools that are both powerful and accessible.

The discovery and implementation of the Lovable â†” GitHub â†” VSCode workflow proved transformative. This approach solved the persistent challenge of balancing rapid prototyping with maintainable, version-controlled development. It's a workflow that provides both the speed needed for experimentation and the structure required for serious software development.

Perhaps most importantly, August was about communication and clarity. The work on explaining vector data and GIS concepts in accessible terms reflects a growing understanding that technical expertise is most valuable when it can be shared and understood by others. The ability to translate complex geospatial concepts into relatable analogies (like the Waze example) demonstrates not just technical knowledge, but the maturity to make that knowledge useful to a broader audience.

The metrics tell a positive story: increased engagement (+302K steps, +72 GISTIPSTER, +6 contacts) while maintaining reasonable LLM costs ($573 vs July's $809), suggesting more efficient and targeted use of AI tools. The consistent lifestyle balance across all areas shows sustainable progress rather than unsustainable sprints.

August closed with a clearer vision of the path forward: building intelligent geographic systems that bridge the gap between complex data and practical decision-making, all while maintaining the simplicity and accessibility that July's experiments proved to be essential.
