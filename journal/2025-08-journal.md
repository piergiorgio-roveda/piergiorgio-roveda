## What I Learned?

### Lovable ↔ GitHub ↔ VSCode

While building my dashboard in Lovable, I realized that the platform is great for quickly developing features, but it doesn’t provide a smooth way to separate or highlight important development steps. To solve this, I explored the GitHub sync feature.

By syncing with GitHub, I can now keep track of my work with proper version control and a clear history of changes. This also allows me to continue development locally with RooCode in VSCode, where I have more flexibility to organize, refactor, and manage the project like a proper software product.

- Lovable → fast prototyping.
- GitHub → version control and history.
- RooCode + VSCode → structured, maintainable development.

This workflow gives me both speed and control, without losing track of progress.
