  "articleBody": "I am a highly adaptable and professional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Developer with more than 17 years of experience in GEODatabase management, WebGIS development, map analysis processing, geographic data analysis, consulting, video training courses, and operational management in the urban planning and mapping areas.\n\nI consult with clients, create geospatial data, automate data extraction functions, and advise colleagues on performance. I provide administrative, technical, operational, and logistical support to my subordinates to ensure that they have the means necessary to perform a myriad of duties. I am hands-on in my approach and go above and beyond to help those get the most out of the support I provide. My strategy builds trust, establishes rapport, and earns respect from those who have been placed under my leadership.\n\nI consistently receive positive performance feedback and aim for excellence in all my endeavors. I'm ready to contribute my expertise as an asset, ultimately benefiting any organization or team.",

      "articleBody": "As a passionate urban planner, I deeply understand the significance of the data lifecycle in shaping sustainable communities. Through my journey in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), I've uncovered the myriad facets of this lifecycle - from harnessing cutting-edge software and theories to collaborating with diverse individuals - all aimed at effectively managing and leveraging data to create thriving urban environments. My goal is to continue advancing in this field, contributing to data-driven urban planning, and making a lasting impact on our cities and communities.\n\nDuring my education and initial experience with ArcGIS Geodatabases and MS Access, I didn't fully grasp their unique structures. However, with guidance from OSGEO and collaboration with system administrators and DBA experts, I successfully implemented a scalable and user-friendly development/production system.\n\nMy journey into WebGIS began with tools like Pmapper and Chameleon, but it was through OSGeoLive that I discovered the potential of QGIS Server, Zoo Project, and Carto (a Drupal project). I developed a strong passion for the latter. When it came to choosing a mapping library, I evaluated OpenLayers and LeafletJS. I opted for LeafletJS due to its stability, especially after experiencing challenges with OpenLayers version updates."

      "articleBody": "In 1994-5 I started playing SimCity 2000 and Transport Tycoon. I became interested in studying Geography and I was continuously browsing atlases. I was already designing many maps, but I did not yet have the right tools to help me analyse the data behind them. Now that I have closed that gap, I can implement my abilities in favour of the resources of our planet.",

      "articleBody": "ArcGIS and MapInfo were the first types of GIS software I started using during my time at university.\n\nQGIS, together with Postgres/PostGIS remains the most suitable tool for each need I have encountered in the last 10 years and I have utilised all the necessary resources to learn it.\n\nI discovered GIS features of MapInfo dedicated to Location Intelligence, in particular Routing, which thanks to the Tom Tom collaboration, has become an excellent tool."

      "articleBody": "The core business of Geomarketing is the production of databases with added value. In fact, customers need to add demographic, social, business and environmental information to their data. The match between internal data and client data input allows to create analyses of market potential, trade value, competition and cannibalization.\n\nAll this data must be entered into dedicated databases and structured in a way that facilitates the analysis. I have cultivated data management in a comprehensive way, starting from collection all the way through to deep analysis.\n\nThe continuous research for software solutions and methods has led me to the development of web interfaces, easy to use and beautiful to consult. These 9 WebApps currently online and accessible only through credentials, are used by about 500 users. The entire Geomarketing team and some of our suppliers use the same WebApps that we deliver to customers, simply because they are faster and more convenient to access than creating a workarea with classic GIS. I have not yet found the same customization possibilities in other WebGIS currently available."
