# Street View–based geospatial analysis, computer vision, and GIS integration

A clean and minimal list, focused strictly on **Street View panoramas → Urban Indexes**:

1. **Green View Index (GVI)** – Quantifies visible vegetation from panoramic imagery.
2. **Sky View Factor (SVF)** – Measures openness of the sky in street canyons.
3. **Built-up Index** – Proportion of visible buildings or façade surfaces.
4. **Pavement Quality Index** – Rates surface conditions and walkability.
5. **Street Furniture Density** – Counts benches, poles, signs, lights per view.
6. **Traffic Sign Density** – Number and type of visible road signs per segment.
7. **Perceived Safety Index** – AI-estimated human perception of safety.
8. **Cleanliness / Disorder Index** – Presence of litter, graffiti, or neglect.
9. **Accessibility Index** – Detection of ramps, crossings, and obstacle-free paths.
10. **Vibrancy Index** – Visual evidence of activity: people, shops, vehicles.

List of methods:

Here’s a **concise list** of methods with minimal technical descriptions:

1. **Semantic Segmentation** – Classify each pixel (e.g., vegetation, sky, building) using models like **DeepLab**, **SegFormer**, or **Mask2Former**.
2. **Object Detection** – Identify and count discrete elements (e.g., signs, benches) with **YOLOv8**, **Detectron2**, or **SAM**.
3. **Scene Classification** – Categorize the whole panorama (residential, park, industrial) using **ResNet**, **CLIP**, or **Vision Transformers**.
4. **Image Quality Analysis** – Measure sharpness, contrast, and texture using **OpenCV** or **scikit-image** metrics.
5. **Color Ratio Analysis** – Compute proportions of RGB channels (green, blue, gray) with **NumPy/OpenCV** for greenery or sky indexes.
6. **Edge and Line Detection** – Extract façade geometry and enclosure using **Canny** or **Hough Transform** in **OpenCV**.
7. **Depth Estimation** – Predict scene depth or 3D structure with **MiDaS**, **DPT**, or **NeRF** models.
8. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** – Detect and read text on façades or signs with **Google Vision**, **Tesseract**, or **EasyOCR**.
9. **Human and Vehicle Detection** – Identify people, cars, and bikes using **YOLO**, **OpenCV DNN**, or **MediaPipe**.
10. **Multimodal Embedding Analysis** – Use **CLIP**, **BLIP-2**, or **Gemini** to derive semantic and perceptual urban attributes from images.

Recent **OpenAI vision models** (like **GPT-5 with image input**, **GPT-4o**, or **Gemini 1.5 Pro**) already integrate **multiple traditional computer-vision capabilities** internally.
That means they can perform, in one multimodal step, what previously required separate models or pipelines.

1. **Semantic Segmentation →** The model can already identify visual regions (“trees,” “road,” “sky”) through pixel-level reasoning without a dedicated segmentation network.

2. **Object Detection →** It can list and count visible elements (signs, cars, benches) directly from an image, replacing YOLO/Detectron for descriptive tasks.

3. **Scene Classification →** It naturally infers the type of place (“residential street,” “commercial avenue”) from contextual cues, no separate classifier needed.

4. **OCR →** Built-in text recognition reads signage or shop names without Tesseract or Google Vision.

5. **Multimodal Embedding Analysis →** The model already links visual and textual context, performing CLIP-like reasoning natively.

**However, traditional CV tech is still needed when:**

1. **Pixel-precision or quantitative outputs** are required (e.g., exact % of greenery for GVI, or precise depth maps).
1. **Large-scale automated pipelines** must process thousands of panoramas offline — current LLM-vision APIs are slower and more expensive.
1. **Training custom urban indexes** demands reproducible numeric consistency, not natural-language outputs.
1. **Offline or open-source control** is needed (for privacy, cost, or reproducibility).

Use **OpenAI vision models** for *interpretation, description, and contextual labeling* of Street View scenes. Use **traditional CV models** (segmentation, depth, edge) for *quantitative, map-ready metrics*.

**LLM-vision models unify semantic understanding**, while **classical CV keeps quantitative precision** — combining both gives the most powerful Street View–based urban indexing workflow.
