- `Context Engineering` â‡’ [The Bottleneck to Better Continuous AI](https://blog.continue.dev/context-engineering-the-bottleneck-to-better-continuous-ai/)
  - Back in 2019, I gave a presentation about building contextual AI assistants at the O'Reilly AI Conference. While AI has progressed dramatically since then, one challenge has remained constant: the art and science of providing the right context at the right time.

| This guide introduces Roo Code and the innovative Boomerang task concept, now integrated into SPARC Orchestration. By following the SPARC methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) and leveraging advanced reasoning models such as o3, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking, and DeepSeek, you can efficiently break down complex projects into modular, secure, and testable subtasks. This configuration ensures best practices throughout the development lifecycleâ€”no hard-coded environment variables, file sizes under 500 lines, and a modular, extensible design. Use this comprehensive setup to drive high-quality output, robust testing, and continuous optimization. |  | https://gist.github.com/ruvnet/a206de8d484e710499398e4c39fa6299#file-roomodes-json | May 5, 2025 10:25 PM |
