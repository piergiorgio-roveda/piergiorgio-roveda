“geoNotebook: A Simple Idea, 22 Years in the Making”
- "Built in 2 weeks, powered by decades of real-world GIS work."
“geoNotebook: Talk to Your Spatial Data. No Code. Just Answers.”
- Bold, modern, and clearly aimed at urban planners and data leaders.  
  It positions geoNotebook as a workflow shift — not a marginal upgrade.
```

Pioneering a **no-code spatial analysis notebook** with AI and a PostGIS geospatial database. An LLM-native geo-analytics notebook — a hybrid between conversational BI and geospatial analytics.

> No scripts. No formulas. Reproducible queries.
>
> LLM-native Notebook for Spatial Intelligence. Live data. Natural language. No code.
>
> Your PostGIS, finally talkative. Query your spatial database the way you think — in blocks, in questions, with maps.

Recently, I quietly built a one-of-a-kind platform — a no-code notebook that lets you explore geospatial data simply by asking natural-language questions. Think of it as a cross between Word, GIS, and ChatGPT — all in one **innovative** tool.

## **What It Is (and Why It’s Different)**

This product was **intentionally designed** to combine capabilities never before brought together in one place:

* **Notebook-style UI** — An interactive notebook interface where you combine maps, charts, tables, and text into cohesive analysis blocks.
* **Direct PostGIS connection** — Real-time link to your spatial database for enterprise-grade geodata queries (no exports, no intermediate layers).
* **LLM-driven queries** — An AI agent (LLM-based) instantly translates plain-language questions into spatial SQL. You ask — it queries PostGIS for you.
* **Modern, multi-platform stack** — Built as a JavaScript-stack SaaS, accessible via web or desktop, delivering a smooth, responsive experience even with heavy datasets.

**Why this matters:** Until now, business-oriented geospatial analysis meant wrestling with GIS software or writing code. Industry surveys show most potential GIS users avoid these tools due to technical complexity. This removes that barrier — **no scripts, no GIS jargon — just ask and see results.**

---

## **Why It Works (Under the Hood)**

* **Schema grounding** — DB introspection + semantic dictionary (synonyms, units, SRID, categories).
* **SQL guardrails** — Constrained generation (grammar), **validator** (pglast), PostGIS function whitelists, row/time limits, safe rollbacks.
* **Transparency** — Buttons for **“Show SQL”**, **“Why this?”**, **“Edit & Re-run”**.
* **Reproducibility** — Prompt + SQL version saved with each block; **snapshots** for export.
* **Performance** — Large responses → **MVT/H3** for maps, **pagination** for tables, **result caching**.
* **Security** — RLS/column-level permissions; PII masking.
* **Cost & latency control** — Batching, cached query plans, small on-prem LLM for query-to-SQL; large LLM only for complex cases.

---

### **Risks (and How They’re Managed)**

* **Hallucination / wrong SQL** → guardrails + explain plans + require-confirm for risky queries.
* **Wrong joins / ambiguous semantics** → semantic layer with declared relationships.
* **Slow queries / high LLM costs** → caching, materialized views, sampling policies.
* **Data team skepticism** → full logs, audits, **manual override** mode.

---

### **Why You Can Trust It**

* **Verified SQL** — Constrained generation + syntax validation + resource limits.
* **Reproducible** — Every block saves prompt, SQL, and dataset version.
* **On-prem or cloud** — Secure connectors; local LLM models available on request.

---

## **Value Metrics (Telemetry)**

* **TTFI (Time To First Insight)**: < 60 seconds
* High % of prompts executed on first try (minimal corrections)
* Low **SQL error rate** and **timeout rate** — queries validated, resource-limited, RLS-compliant
* **Average cost per answer** (LLM + DB): \~€15/day per user (average usage)

---

## **How It Works (In Action)**

Imagine an urban planner exploring data effortlessly:

```
Show me which suburban areas had population growth above 10% 
and property values below the city average.
```

Within seconds, the geoNotebook AI agent understands the question, runs the right PostGIS queries, and **produces an interactive map, chart, and table — plus a descriptive summary — all within the open note**, without copy-pasting or using external tools.

The planner can refine the question or add context in a text block, never touching SQL or Python. Heavy lifting (spatial joins, buffers, aggregations, spatial indexes like H3, heatmaps) happens behind the scenes so users focus on insight, not syntax.

---

Behind this simple interface is **deliberate technical design**:
The UI isn’t just attractive — it’s built for serious analysis workflows, like reproducible research documents combining narrative and visuals. Direct DB connection keeps data in place (critical for government and enterprise teams). The LLM agent is optimized for spatial reasoning, leveraging the latest in text-to-SQL AI.

As recent studies confirm, large language models can reliably generate geospatial SQL, acting as an assistant for GIS analysts — exactly the role geoNotebook plays.

## **Impact for Urban Planning and Public-Sector Analysis**

This project addresses **real-world needs** in **urban planning, environmental monitoring, and urban data science**. Public-sector planners and analysts often have huge spatial datasets (zoning, transport, census, environmental sensors) but limited staff to process them. geoNotebook no-code bridges that gap.

It enables experts to ask complex spatial questions and get instant answers:

* **Urban planning** — Assess infrastructure needs or zoning impacts by querying city DBs in natural language. Instantly visualize results on a map for policy decisions.
* **Environmental monitoring** — Track land-use changes or identify risk areas (flood zones, heat islands) with simple queries. Get charts and maps that update as new sensor data streams into PostGIS.
* **Urban research** — Rapid prototyping of analyses. Correlate air quality with traffic patterns by simply asking and letting the AI process spatial data.

By lowering the technical barrier, we’re expanding access to geospatial analysis. Industry voices note that GIS-AI convergence is **enabling more advanced predictive modeling for planning and environmental management**.

---

## **Key Strengths**

* Perfect for fast reports, project knowledge sharing, data availability checks, and qualitative data validation.
* Block types: maps, charts, tables, images, diagrams, and text (with bold, italic, underline, lists).
* Maps/charts/tables/diagrams are generated via natural language — the AI agent analyzes your request, returns the best output, and shows the SQL for verification, with the option to refine.
* Cloud-based or desktop version with local data.
* Shareable link to a non-editable but fully interactive version (like a live PDF).
* Each note snapshots the data, so it stays unchanged even if the source DB updates.

---

### **In Development**

* Tags, pin/favorites, inline rename, clear button tooltips
* Projects/roles — personal notes and shared notes via multi-user access
* “Live” mode — data updates directly from DB
* Batch note generation from templates for sequential geographic elements
* Comments / track changes
* LLM usage logging

## **Sample Prompts That Sell the Product**

* **Map** — “Show construction sites opened in the last 30 days, colored by status; filter within 500m of schools.”
* **Table** — “Top 10 accident hotspots 2024 by municipality with YoY change vs 2023.”
* **Chart** — “Monthly line of new building permits from 2022 to today, comparing downtown vs suburbs.”
* **Text** — “Summarize in 5 bullet points the major changes compared to the previous quarter.”

## **Market & Alternatives**

After thorough research, I believe I’m the first to propose this **exclusive** integration of notebook UI + interactive map/chart blocks + PostGIS + natural-language LLM interface.

It’s bold, but I’ve followed a winding path through multiple stacks, papers, and industry pitches — and this is fully adaptable, ready for high-intensity use, and already running in my cloud environment.

Currently in **private development** — no public demo or open access yet. I’m refining it while sourcing valuable sample datasets to further improve the experience.

### **Why It’s Not Notion / Obsidian / ArcGIS**

* **Vs Notion / Obsidian** — They are document editors. Here, you **run real DB queries** and display **native maps**. This is live geospatial calculation, data governance, and visualization — not static notes.
* **Vs ArcGIS** — ArcGIS is a **full GIS suite** (editing, geoprocessing, data management). This is **conversational analysis & storytelling** with low latency and **zero scripting** — complementary, only replacing “light dashboard / quick report” use cases.
